  "body": "NuGridpy\r\n========\r\n\r\nNuGridPy is a Python package containing tools to access and analyse \r\n(e.g. plot) various output formats (including the hdf5-based se format) \r\nfrom NuGrid codes (mppnp and ppn) and from the MESA stellar evolution\r\ncode. \r\n\r\nNuGridPy has been developed, and is maintained and supported by the \r\n[NuGrid](http://www.nugridstars.org) collaboration. Feedback and input from the community \r\nis welcome. Examples of NuGridPy in action can be tried out on the NuGrid \r\n[WENDI](http://wendi.nugridstars.org) server. \r\nNuGridPy uses the [future package](http://python-future.org) so that it \r\ncan be used with both python 2 and 3.\r\n \r\nIn principle the NuGridPy package can be used on any stellar\r\nevolution code output if the tools to write se hdf5 files available on\r\nthe NuGrid web page are used.  The `mesa.py` module will work with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net)\r\nASCII output in the `LOGS` directory. These modules were written with an\r\ninteractive work mode in mind, in particular taking advantage of the\r\ninteractive ipython session or inside an ipython notebook.\r\n\r\nNuGridPy has been made possible, in part, through support from [JINA](http://www.jinaweb.org), [Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html) and [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca) to [NuGrid](http://www.nugridstars.org) and its members.",
